- 6-4.c) The Hint 1 for 6-4.c) has nothing to do with the actual implementation, since in the mastersolution itself the students are only supposed to implement the leap frog scheme, and they may rely on the initialization of the matrices A, B and M via the corresponding functions getA_full(), getB_full(), getM_full().
I would suggest to either remove the Hint (rather confuses than serving any purpose) or else to ask for the initialization of the matrices themselves, in a separate subtask, where you ask them to implement the functions  getA_full(), getB_full(), getM_full() on their own. In such a subtask, the Hint may be of purpose. 

- 6-4.d)/e)/f) Very confusing that you ask for the extension of the main function to obtain the file "solution.csv", then you actually show the whole extension of the main function which also implements the output of the file "energies.csv", whereas you ask for the implementation of the computation of the energies only in subtask e), and for the whole extension of the main function only in subtask f). 
Hence, I would reverse the order of subtask d) and e), and furthermore, merge subtask d) and f).
