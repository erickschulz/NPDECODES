- Preliminaries in problem description: Problem **does** contain LehrFEM++
- Location of `LocalLaplaceQFEX` was updated: local_laplace_qfe.cc -> locallaplaceqfe.cc
- locallaplaceqfe does not contain providers for the right-hand side
- Part (a): Write that the function to be implemented is located in qfeinterpolator.h
- Part (a): Maybe mention `globalCoordinate` function
- Part (a): Tells to check for consistency with LF_ASSERT_MSG, but the solution code does not
- Part (d): File was renamed: qfe_provider_tester.h -> qfeprovidertester.h
