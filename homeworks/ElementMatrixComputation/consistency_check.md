A list of inconcistencies between the code and the problem statement:

In the following, when I say the links to lecture document are broken I am testing the Problems_full.pdf from
http://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~ralfh/tmp/NPDEFL_Problems_full.pdf

- Hints@ in header weirdly links to the index of a site (same for all problems)

- Links for the sections on which the problem relies are broken (same for all problems)

- problem code folder link still links to Gitlab (fixed)

- All links to Lecture document right under the header are broken (same for all problems)

- typo in "Refresh youir Knowledge" (fixed)

- link to solve.h still points to a Gitlab repo. (fixed)

- (2-8.c) wrong function definition, there is no mesh_p anymore (fixed)

- (2-8.d) it is not indicated where is solvePoissonBCP(). It is in solve.cc. (fixed)

- (2-8.d) link to Gitlab (fixed)

- (2-8.e) ElementMatrixComputation_main.cc --> elementmatrixcomputation_main.cc (fixed)

- (2-8.i) still gitlab links (fixed)

- (2-8.j) still gitlab links (fixed)
