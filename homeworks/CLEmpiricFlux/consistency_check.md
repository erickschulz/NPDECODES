- Tablet notes do not exist **(To be fixed by Ralf)**
- Constructor of `UniformCubicSpline` takes `const` vectors **(fixed)**
- Part (c): Argument `initsupp` is taken by const reference **(fixed)**
- Part (d): The solution code does not depend on (8-6.c) **(yes it does)**
- Hint to part (d): Hint tells to use `findSupport`. However, this function is not used in the solution code **(To be discussed with Ralf)**
- Part (h): The function `solveCauchyProblem` is found in the source file and is not templated on a type `FUNCTOR` **(fixed)**
- Part (h): `mu0` is passed via const reference **(fixed)**
- Solution to part (h): First bullet point: Some typo in latex command to format GodunovFlux **(fixed)**
- Maybe also tell students to implement `semiDiscreteRhs`
