##Inconsistencies (FIXED!)

- Introduction box: Link to the code folder refers to an old eth gitlab folder. (FIXED!)
- Subproblem c): The solution contains a broken reference to the variational formulation. (FIXED!)
- Subproblem e): The solution code was updated. (FIXED!)
- Subproblem g): The description contains wrong function signatures for some of the member functions of the class "GradProjRhsProvider". (FIXED!)
- Subproblem g): The solution code was updated. (FIXED!)
- Subproblem h): Hint 1 contains a broken reference to the variational formulation. (FIXED!)
- Subproblem h): The Lehrfem++ function fix_flagged_solution_comp_alt was renamed to FixFlaggedSolutionCompAlt (FIXED!)
- Subproblem h): The function signature contains a typo (termplate), the dofhandler argument was renamed to dofh. (FIXED!)
- Subproblem h): The solution code was updated. (FIXED!)
- Subproblem i): The unit test signature was updated to TEST(ProjectionOntoGradients, div_free_test) (FIXED!)
- Subproblem i): The solution code was updated. (FIXED!)
- Subproblem k): The unit test signature was updated to TEST(ProjectionOntoGradients, exact_sol_test) (FIXED!)
- Subproblem k): The link in the solution refers to an old eth gitlab folder. (FIXED!)
