Problem 2-4: Linear finite elements for two-point boundary value problems

In this exercise, you ask for the implementation of functions solving the stated variational problems (A) to (C). In the mastersolution, the implementation relies heavily on three helper functions, **computeA()**, **computeM()** and **computeRHS()**; which calculate the matrix entries corresponding to the Galerkin matrix of the Laplace operator with non-constant coefficient function alpha using composite midpoint rule, the matrix entries corresponding to the mass matrix weighted by the coefficient function gamma using the trapezoidal rule, and the entries of the right hand side vector using composite trapezoidal rule, respectively.
In the exercise, you do not ask for the implementation of these helper functions. I would suggest to either include their implementation as an additional subtask before asking for the implementation of solving the variational problems; or else, to refer to their implementation when asking to solve the variational problems, such that when the student solve the equations numerically, they make use of these three helper functions. You may also want to state in a Hint that it might be useful to first implement functions that initialize the appropriate matrix entries. If the students are not aware of these functions, their solution is prone to look very different from the mastersolution, and more importantly, they will have redundant code when not relying on the functionality of the above mentioned functions.
