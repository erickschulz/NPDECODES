- Part (c): File was moved: radau_three_timestepping_ode.cc -> radauthreetimesteppingode.cc
- Part (c): Equation (6.1.10): Used u instead of y in initial condition
- Part (d): File was moved: radau_three_timestepping_ode.cc -> radauthreetimesteppingode.cc
- Part (d): Mention that m \in {10pow(2,k) | k \in {1, 2, ..., nIter}}
- Solution to part (d): The table of the convergence rates in the solution is different from the one generated by the code
- Solution to part (e): Typo: Bottom right element of left argument to kronecker product with M should be 1
- Class structure of `Radau3MOLTimestepper is outdated
- Insert another subtask before part (f) to implement `TrapRuleLinFEElemVecProvider`
- Part (f): Dile was moved: radau_three_timestepping.cc -> radauthreetimestepping.cc
- Part (f): Missing a factor of v in the right hand side functional
- Part (h): Code for `dropMatrixRowsColumns` is outdated
- Part (i): File was moved: radau_three_timestepping.cc -> radauthreetimestepping.cc
- Hint to part (i): The hint tells to use `lf::uscalfe::ReactionDiffusionElementMatrixProvider`. However, the solution uses `LinFEMassMatrixProvider`. Either change the hint and add an additional subtask to implement `LinFEMassMatrixProvider` or change the problem template.
- Solution to part (i): Typo: use -> used
- Solution to part (i): File was renamed: radau_three_timestepping.cc -> radauthreetimestepping.cc
- Part (j): File was renamed: radau_three_timestepping.cc -> radauthreetimestepping.cc
- Part (j): Move the description of what `discreteEvolutionOperator` should do in front of this subtask
- Hint to part (j): There is an unresolved reference to the script
- Hint to part (j): Typo: ... you **could** already **have** initialized ...
- Hint to part (j): Missing an equal sign at the definition of A_\oplus
- Part (k): File was renamed: radau_three_timestepping.cc -> radauthreetimestepping.cc
- Part (k): Signature of `solveHeatEvolution` is wrong. The argument `double final_time` is missing
- Part (l): Also tell that the argument `final_time` should be 1
- Part (l): The final temperature distribution is written to discrete_heat_solution.vtk and not heat.vtk
- Solution to part (l): Visualized heat distribution is wrong
