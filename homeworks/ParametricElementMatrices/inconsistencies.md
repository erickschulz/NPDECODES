- Typo in problem description `lf::geomtry` -> `lf::geometry` **(fixed)**
- Solution to part a: Typo in point 2: Them -> Then **(fixed)**
- Solution to part a: Error in the strong form of the BVP: Missing transpose d(x)d(x) -> d(x)d(x)^T **(fixed)**
- Solution to part a: Error in boundary conditions. Missing A factor of 1 + d(x)d(x)^T **(fixed)**
- Solution to part a: Diffusion tensor goes over the page margins **(???)**
- Part b: Code in problem formulation is outdated **(fixed)**
- Hint to part b: Broken reference to lecture document
- Part b: File was renamed anisotropic_diffusion_element_matrix_provider.cc -> anisotropicdiffusionelementmatrixprovider.cc **(fixed)**
- Solution to part b: Code in the solution PDF is outdated **(fixed)**
- Part c: File was renamed fe_source_elem_vec_provider.cc -> fesourceelemvecprovider.cc **(fixed)**
- Part c: Code in problem formulation is outdated **(fixed)**
- Part c: Wrong argument name in the second to last sentence of the problem formulation: `w_coeff_vec` -> `coeff_expansion` **(fixed)**
- Solution to part c: Code in the solution PDF is outdated **(fixed)**
- Part e: Code in problem formulation is outdated **(fixed)**
- Hint 1 to part e: `lf::mesh::utils::flagEntitiesOnBoundary` is unreadable as it goes over the page margins **(???)**
- Solution to part e: The implementation of the class constructior is not asked in the problem. This code can be removed from the PDF
- Solution to part e: The code in the solution PDF is outdated **(fixed)**
- Hint 2 to part f: Broken reference to lecture document
- Part f: Bullet point 2 in the problem description provides wrong arguments to `lf::mesh::test_utils::GenerateHybrid2DTestMesh` **(fixed)**
- Part f: The problem asks to implement the test by comparing element matrices. However, the code assembles the full galerkin matrices and compares them **(TODO)**
- Part g: Add a link to the documentation of `lf::uscalfe::NodalProjection` **(fixed)**
